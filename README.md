# Customer Abandonment and Price Sensitivity Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains information and resources related to the analysis carried out on e-commerce customer data to investigate cart abandonment drivers and price sensitivity.

Working on this project allowed for the following to be carried out on the dataset:
- Dataset Walkthrough
- Understanding Dataset Hierarchy
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Customer Segmentation Analysis
- Strategic Recommendation Formulation

The project was carried out using **Microsoft Excel** for data transformation, analysis, and dashboard creation. It involved the use of advanced Excel formulas, PivotTables, and interactive dashboard design principles.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel** — data analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation
- **PivotTables & Power Query** — data transformation and aggregation
- **Advanced Excel Formulas** — calculated metrics and logical operations
- **Excel Slicers** — interactive filtering and data segmentation

## Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to analyze customer abandonment behavior, identify key drivers of cart abandonment, and visualize insights through an interactive Excel dashboard.

The final interactive dashboard will:
- **Identify Primary Abandonment Drivers** — Determine the main reasons customers abandon carts
- **Segment Customers by Demographics** — Analyze abandonment patterns by age group and gender
- **Analyze Category Performance** — Determine which product categories experience the highest abandonment rates
- **Evaluate Search Method Impact** — Identify how different discovery methods affect abandonment
- **Provide Strategic Recommendations** — Offer data-backed solutions to reduce abandonment

**Generated KPIs:**
- Total customers
- Total abandonments
- Abandonment rate
- Price-sensitive abandonment percentage
- Top affected category
- Most vulnerable demographic segment
- Abandonment by search method

## Features
- Interactive Excel dashboard with multiple visualization panels
- Slicers for dynamic filtering by:
  - Age Group
  - Gender
  - Product Category
  - Abandonment Reason
  - Search Method
- Real-time KPI tracking
- Category comparison charts
- Demographic analysis section
- Strategic recommendations summary
